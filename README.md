# 🧠 Neural Network Classifier (A, B, C Letters)

This project implements a **feedforward neural network from scratch** using only **NumPy**.  
The network classifies synthetic 5×6 binary pixel images of the letters **A, B, and C**.  

It is part of **Module 11: Project – Neural Network from Scratch**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Creates synthetic dataset (letters A, B, C represented as 5×6 binary grids).  
- Implements a **two-layer neural network** (input → hidden → output).  
- Uses **sigmoid activation** and custom **backpropagation** logic.  
- Tracks **loss and accuracy** during training.  
- Displays training performance with **matplotlib plots**.  
- Tests predictions by showing letter images with predicted labels.
